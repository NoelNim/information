                    Josh thinks we are a bussines that develops beer cans, we dont. We develop all sort of things, from discord bots to games to all sorts of diffrent things like applications. Who is Josh? Well he is the empolyee with the longest employee of the month streak (maybe because he is our only employee) and he is the only monkey working for us (maybe because he is still the only employee) and he is also a really inteligent monkey, Josh can calculate complex math questions in seconds. Some would say he is faster than a calculator, some would say he is faster than a human. Either way Josh is smart. Josh is the one who developed our website, he is the one who made the beer can design and he is also the one who is making all these <i>beautiful</i> icons. Honestly, Josh is truly a 1 in a 1 x 10^100. Without Josh, I dont know what where we would be. <br><br>
                    Why did we hire Josh? Well, because one, as soon as we saw his beautiful art hanging on his window. He got hired on the spot. Josh is now our senior artist, our senior engineer, our senior marketer and our senior janitor. Josh is even <i>so nice</i> that he decided to take the job, without getting paid! Ofcourse we still pay him, Josh earns around 1<span>&#208;</span>/s. This is why we love Josh, he is flexible and smart. Josh is supplied with the tools he needs to develop and improve, so why shouldnt you? This is what we at datsmin belive in, that you should be provided with the tools you need to work as efficient as possible.<br><br>
                    Be like a Josh:<br>
                    <b>J</b>ust be<br>
                    <b>O</b>n datsmin and you are<br>
                    <b>S</b>ure to be safe and<br>
                    <b>H</b>appy<br><br>
                    So, what have we achieved yet?<br>
                    Really, we havent achieved anything yet. We have built a discord bot, that isnt live yet but it hopefully will be soon, for now we have a seperate bot callled "datsmin verify" which is available for invite <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817369727944097813&permissions=268446720&scope=bot" id="joshLink">here</a>, currently you need to manually set up an enviroment for the bot, like roles and channels [read more <a href="#">here</a>]. Otherwise we have been developing this website to be more functional, we have been developing an app and we have also been developing games for your computer. Along with all this developing we have been learning, me and Josh have been learning new coding languages to be able to expand our variety of apps and tools that we can develop. Because our main focus is for you to have a safe and reliable experience. Because in the end, our focus is the user. <br><br>
                    And yes, Josh is a monkey.<br>
                    And he is from the jungle.<br>
                    And he is cool.<br><br>
